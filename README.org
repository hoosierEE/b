* b
  I want to understand what's going on over at kparc.com/b.
  Based on the docs, it appears to be full source code for a compiler for a C-like language.
  The compiler is implemented in Whitney-style C, an acquired taste.

  The readme claims that the generated code is on par with gcc/llvm at highest optimization settings, but with massively shorter compile times, and smaller binaries.

* make
  No ~k.c~ on my machine, so I will just try to ~make /bin/b~.

  - macos: lots of "function definition is not allowed here" errors.  Seems to have missed a macro somewhere (thinks ~R~ is a function definition but it's really a macro).
  - Ubuntu 16.04: builds ~b.c~ with some warnings

* b program
  - accepts ~*.b~ programs from the command line
  - does not permit spaces (repl exits)
  - no error handling (segfault)
